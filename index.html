            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                I'm currently a graduate research student at Purdue University on a full M.S./PhD track in Mechanical Engineering. My research focuses on
                liquid sprays, combustion, and propulsion at the Zucrow Laboratories. I completed my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at Oregon State in June 2018.
                There I developed and furthered my passion for aerospace with
                <a href="https://www.osuaiaa.com/">Oregon State AIAA</a>. I worked on sounding rocketry teams since I started and used the rocket as a platform
                for my senior capstone project. I also gained research experience at Oregon State under Dr. David Blunck working at the
                Propulsion Lab. I worked as a undergrad research assistant on a pulse detonation engine and performed research on energetic materials.
            </p>
            <h3>Why PhD?</h3>
              <p>
                People always ask me why I want to get a PhD and for a while I didn't really have a good answer. I think this animation by
                <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/">Matt Might</a> is the best way to explain.

            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <img src="images/mission_patch.png" width="200" alt="patch" style="float:right">
            <p>My capstone project was a sounding rocketry project for the 2018 Spaceport America Cup (formerly ESRA/IREC). The team was made of 18 seniors across
             mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science. There were 3 people per sub team in aerodynamics and recovery, propulsion, structures,
             payload, avionics, and computer science. My focus was in propulsion and this page follows the timeline of the project.

             <br><br>Propulsion is in charge of designing, manufacturing and testing the propulsion system as well as running launch systems. The design phase officially starts
             in September with the build phase starting in January. Solid propulsion was chosen very early on, mainly because OSU is not ready for hybrid/liquid and solids
             were used in previous years.
            </p>
            <h2>Version 1.0 </h2>
            <p>At the end of the Fall term the full design at the time was what we called, Version 1.0. This version was ready to be built and tested. However, the exact propellant
              formulation was a place holder. The team wanted to perform sub-scale testing first to characterize different propellant formulations. The design consisted of a 6061-T6
              aluminum casing that had a 5.0" inner diameter, a minimum wall thickness of 0.175" and was 40" long. The ends of the casing had larger diameters that matched the inner
              diameter of the airframe to ensure concentricity. To insulate the casing a fiberglass liner was chosen. The nozzle was to be made up of isomold graphite. The grain configuration
              was BATES: made up of 4 8" grains. A cross section is shown in the image below.
              <br>
              <br>
              <img src="images/v1.jpg" alt="version1">
            </p>
            <h2>Sub Scale Testing</h2>
            <p>
              The sub scale configuration consisted of a 2.0" inner diameter, 0.25" wall 6061-T6 aluminum casing. It was 12" long and had 2 4" inch BATES grains with a 0.75" core. The team performed many sub scale tests to investigate the ideal perforamce parameters for the propellant. The first round of testing had a propellant called "SOS" which
              is a slow burning propellant and "RIO" which is an APCP, high metals, fast burning propellant.

              </center>
              <br>
              As it turns out, SOS was too slow and RIO was too fast so the catalyst from RIO was removed and we called the propellant "Bare Bones" or "BB".

          <h2>V1.0 Testing</h2>
          <p>
            Once the propellant was characterized, the team moved toward the first full scale static test fire, which occurred on March 3rd, 2018. Prior to firing, however, the casing is tested
            hydrostatically. Which involves filling the casing up with water and using a grease gun to apply internal pressure. The max chamber pressure that was simulated was 800 psi so the casing
            was tested to 1200 psi for 30 seconds. Unfortunately, the test resulted in a catastrophic failure due to an overpressure. The expected max pressure was 800 psi, the actual was nearing 2300.
            The two videos below show the failure. The first video is being played back at about 1/15 speed.

            <br>
            This is a high speed video captured at 5000 Hz with a resolution of 1280x720. At about 55 seconds you can see the pressure wave hit the mirror.

            <br>

            The two plots below show the chamber pressure over time. A load cell was used to record thrust data, however, the load cell was destroyed immediately upon ignition and did note
            produce and meaningful data.

            <br>
            The failure was attributed to an significant amount of surface area that burn unexpectedly. The outside of the grains are supposed to be inhibited by casting tubes but the casting tubes did note
            hold up to the extreme heat and pressure. Miraculously, a propellant grain was found about 20 feet from the test stand, shown below. The grain was the primary piece of evidence that allowed us to come
            to our conclusion.

            <br>
          </p>
          <h2>V1.1 Testing</h2>
          <p>
            The design of the motor went largely unchanged with only a few minor changes. The payload became heavier so more energy was needed from the motor. Another grain of propellant was added, extending
            the motor by 5". The wall thickness of the casing was increased by 0.010". The final change was to the propellant; based on what our mentors had seen in the prior mix, they recommended
            the addition of a bonding agent. The bonding agent was a tetra-functional polyol chemical called "NPE". The team had an exceptionally fast turn around time of just 20 days after the first test. The second test occurred on March 23rd, 2018.

            <br>
            <br>

            </video>
            </center>
            <br>

            Once again, the test resulted in a failure due to an overpressure but for a different reason than the first test. The expected max pressure was 600 psi and as the plot shows, the pressure reached
            nearly 1900 psi.
            <br>
            <br>

            </center>
            <br>
            The team had many different theories but the true reason was not realized until
            about 2 weeks later after more subscale testing was performed. Tests that we performed along with testing that our mentors did, it was determined that the bonding agent had an adverse affect
            on the propellant chemistry which caused the overpressure. After the failure mode was determined, the team decided to switch to a propellant that had been well characterized by OSU in the past.
            A summary of our propellant characterizations can be seen below.

            <br>
            Barebones is the propellant used in the first test, Barebones v2 was used in the second test and Orange Kool-aid is the propellant that the team switched to after the second test.
            All propellants are APCP based.
          </p>
          <h2>Mid Scale Testing</h2>
          <p>
            To be absolutely sure that the propellant chemistry, packing method, the liner, and the casting tubes are all up to spec, the performed what we called a mid scale test. The casing for the test
            was the same diameter as the previous two tests, but only half the length. The test was conducted on April 15th, 2018.

            <br>
            <br>
            <center>

            </center>
            <br>

            After many months of work, the propulsion team had a successful test. The expected max pressure was within 10 psi of the actual value. A plot of the chamber pressure vs. time is
            shown below.

            <br>

          </p>

          <h2>V1.2 Design</h2>
          <p>
            After the success of the midscale test, it was time to test the full scale configuration once again. The design of this version is very similar to the prior versions. It used the same
            liner and casting tubes. It also had the same retention methods. The largest change is the grain geometry. As the cross section shows, the inner diameter of the propellant grains
            are stepped. This was done to move the center of mass of motor assembly as far forward as possible to increase the stability margin of the rocket. The radial holes near the nozzle
            end were a new addition as well (which was tested in the mid scale). The holes are threaded such that button head cap screws pass through the airframe and into the casing. One of the holes is used for the rail button
            anchor. Total propellant mass was 14 kg and the dry mass of motor assembly is about 13.5 kg. The third full scale test was on May 10th.

          <br>

          To put it shortly, the team was ecstatic! One of our mentors said "That was the best looking solid rocket test I've ever seen. Textbook even." Calculated impulse was 26.5 kNs.

          </p>
          <h2>Test Launch</h2>
          <p>
            After the success of the static test fire it was finally time for a test launch. We had gambled on the motor working on May 10th by making another batch of propellant for a subsequent flight
            test following the test. Two days later, the entire team packed up and drove out to Brothers, OR for a flight test.
            <br>

            <br>

            As the video shows the motor experienced a combustion instability at approximately t+0.5 seconds. The rocket then increased it's angle from vertical slightly. However, the rocket
            was already traveling fast enough for passive aerodynamic stability to take over and correct itself. The rocket stood 12'4" tall and had a lift off weight of 45 kg, reached a
            max velocity of 536.4 m/s (Mach 1.6). Apogee was 25,000 ft AGL.
          </p>

          <h2>Spaceport America Cup</h2>
          <p>
            After a year's worth of work it was time to travel to Spaceport America in New Mexico to compete. The team traveled the day after graduation and drove
            for 36 hours. The range opened on June 20th but we stood down due to high winds. The next day we came back to Spaceport at 2:30 am to begin
            integrating and preparing for launch.

            <br>
            <center>
            <video  width="600" controls>
              <source src="videos/spaceport_launch.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>
            </center>
            <br>

            Against everyone's hopes and dreams the motor suffered a chuff (combustion instability) at about t+1s. The nozzle was ejected along with all of the propellant.
            The burning mass that is falling in the video is a piece of propellant. The upper section of the airframe was shredded. Miraculously, the motor was still fixed
            to the lower airframe, but only just. The nose cone and payload were recovered with minimal damage.
            <br>

            I encourage you to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxc1HLs-mfQ&feature=player_embedded"> this video.</a>
            It's a bit long but shows the two launch events. It has much better angles of the launches as well. The Brothers launch occurs at 3:36 in the video.
            The Spaceport launch occurs at 6:35. Our launch was also livestreamed by Spaceport America, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/spaceportamericacup/videos/2054253267972434/"> the video can be found here.</a>
